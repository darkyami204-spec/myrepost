      'Martin Garrix is a Dutch DJ, producer, and songwriter who has become one of the most influential figures in modern electronic dance music. Born Martijn Gerard Garritsen on May 14, 1996, in Amstelveen, Netherlands, he broke onto the global scene at just 17 years old with his explosive 2013 hit "Animals," a track that redefined big-room EDM and became a festival anthem worldwide.',
      '## The Early Years',
      'Growing up in Amstelveen, just outside Amsterdam, Garrix showed an early interest in music. He began playing guitar at age 8 and started experimenting with digital audio workstations by 11.

The track\'s minimalistic yet powerful drop, featuring a distinctive synth lead and driving bassline, captured the energy of the big-room house movement. It topped charts in over 10 countries, including the UK, Belgium, and his native Netherlands, and has since been certified multi-platinum in numerous territories. The success of "Animals" catapulted Garrix from an unknown teenager to an international star virtually overnight.',

His versatility spans progressive house, future bass, pop, and club-driven EDM, allowing him to dominate both mainstream charts and underground festival stages.',
      '## STMPD RCRDS: Building an Empire',
      'In 2016, seeking creative independence, Garrix founded his own label, STMPD RCRDS. The label name comes from "stamped records," reflecting his desire to leave a lasting mark on the industry. STMPD RCRDS has grown into a respected force in the electronic music industry, showcasing both established artists and emerging talent while maintaining Garrix\'s commitment to musical innovation.',

He has become a role model for aspiring producers worldwide, proving that age is no barrier to artistic achievement.
